ProblemStatement
---------------------------
INPUT:You should give 3 inputs in single line separated by space, C N Q,where C is
the choice your friend makes whether to start with all heads up or tail. So it will
have two values either 1 or 2. 1 means all head up and 2 means all tail up. N is the
number of coin and Q means what you need to count after N round of game. So Q
will also have two values either 1 or 2 where 1 means you need to count how
many coins are with head up and 2 means how many coins are with tail up.

EXAMPLE : 1 5 2
Means initially all coins are head up, there are 5 coins so game will be of 5 round
and you need to calculate number of tails up at the end of 5 rounds
In the game in Example: C=1, so initial arrangement of coins are H HHHH, and
now your friend will play 5 rounds and coin faces will be changed as follows
After the 1st Round: T H HHH
After the 2nd Round: H T H HH
After the 3rd Round: T H T H H
After the 4th Round: H T H T H
After the 5th Round: T H T H T
Now the value of Q is 2 so we need to count the number of coins with tail facing
up. So the output comes out to 3
OUTPUT: 3(For the above input)
